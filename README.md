In `foxbms\documentation` the configuration of the doxygen documentation for the primary and secondary MCU can be found.
The software for the MCUs is found in `foxbms\embedded-software`. This includes the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), the real-time operating system FreeRTOS and the BMS application itself.
